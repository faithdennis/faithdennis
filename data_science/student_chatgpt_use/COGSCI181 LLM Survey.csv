These waves originate in the pons (part of the brainstem), propagate to the lateral geniculate nucleus (a visual relay center in the thalamus), and finally reach the occipital cortex (the visual processing area of the brain)...""","""Ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) waves are a signature of REM sleep. They represent the physiological mechanism of REM sleep that specifically limits the processing of external information. PGO waves look just like a message sent from the pons to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the visual thalamus, the occipital cortex, and other areas of the brain. The dedicated visual pathway of PGO waves can be interpreted by the brain as visual information, leading to the visual hallucinosis of dreams. PGO waves are considered to be both a reflection of REM sleep brain activity and causal to dreams due to their stimulation of the cortex…""","""REM sleep has many different brain features to it. The first of which is your electrical brain wave activity. The top of the brain, the cortex, looks almost identical to that which you have when you are awake, which is stunning because you are not conscious. You're lying completely still, no presence of muscle tone whatsoever, yet your brain seems to be just as on fire with electrical activity as it is when you are awake. Coming down a step, there are these unique pulses of electrical bursts that come up from the brain stem up to this sensory relay state center in the brain called the thalamus, and then they were initially recorded out in the back of the brain in the visual cortex. Hence these PGO waves describe the three sites that I just mentioned going from the brainstem, the pons, up to the thalamus, a part of it called the geniculate, and then out to the back of the brain called the occipital cortex, PGO…""","Resource A is officially recommended by the course instructor and staff, while Resource B is recommended by other students in the course, including people you know.
