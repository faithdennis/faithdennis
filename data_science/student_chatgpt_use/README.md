# Unconscious drivers of student ChatGPT use
This repository contains a novel research project studying the unconscious drivers of ChatGPT usage among college students.

An anonymous survey was conducted from undergraduates at UC Berkeley in order to probe heuristics and link them to reported ChatGPT usage. The data collected over the span of 1.5 weeks is located in the CSV. The analysis is provided in the analysis notebook. Findings support previous research and offer new insights into the primary mechanisms that influence ChatGPT use.
