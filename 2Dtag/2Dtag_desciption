Hi! Welcome to my 2D tag readme. 

2DTag is a simple game I developed when learning object oriented programming demonstrating the four principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

The game is based on the campus where I went to university and can include up to two players for a tag - like mechanism. 
Some additional components to the gameplay I may add in the future include automating the second player when not manually controlled. 
The files provided range from underlying game mechanics to player and map design. 
RandomUtils was provided to me to modify, and I designed the implementation of and wrote all other files. Enjoy!
