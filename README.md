### Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Faith. This is a repo I'm building to feature different projects I want to share.

ðŸŒ± I am currently growing my software development skills and sharpening them while studying artificial intelligence algorithms and robotics at university. 

âœ¨ My goal is to develop strong software dev skills and knowledge of fundamental concepts in DevOps and AI/ML and use them in algorithm development and deployment and perception in distributed robotic systems. 

My strengths as a developer: detail oriented, values clean, well designed code, good problem solving skills, experience teaching others, learning new things and utilizing resources
My weaknesses as a developer: may need to ask a lot of questions to understand the problem, stepping away from a bug I'm trying to resolve, remembering built-in functions and syntax and retaining information I don't use a lot, lack of experience in industry

You can reach me on LinkedIn for any questions. Thanks.
