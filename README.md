### Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Faith. This is a repo I'm building to feature different projects I would like to share.

ðŸŒ± I am currently growing my software development skills and sharpening them while studying artificial intelligence algorithms and robotics at university. ðŸŒ±

âœ¨ My goal is to develop strong software dev skills and knowledge of fundamental concepts in DevOps and AI/ML and use them in algorithm development and deployment and perception in distributed robotic systems. You can reach me on LinkedIn for any questions. Thanks. âœ¨
